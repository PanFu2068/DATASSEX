#Here you can change some additional options to customize your experience with the plugin.

#Below you can set by how much the scores will decrease on death in /deathReset command (in % 0-100). No matter the percentage, player's score will always decrease by at least 1.
#Example:   deathResetVal: 30 => scores decrease by 30%, rounded up.
deathResetVal: 100               #0-100

#If set to 'false' players won't get scores from killing mobs spawned by Mob Spawners.
countSpawnerMob: true              #true/false

#If set to 'true' disable the power-up effects you get from killing mobs, as well as disable getting scores.
disablePowers: false               #true/false

#If set to 'false' disables the Welcome Message for new players joining the server

#Here are the Mob's statistics, which you can change to your liking, but 2 things first: 
#1 - Flying mobs are unaffected by changing movement speed so They don't have such option.
#2 - Damage you place here is the 'normal' damage. That means on 'normal' difficulty. Most damage is naturally changed in the game by the difficulty setting, following a formula:
#easy: (normalDMG / 2)+1
#hard: normalDMG * 1.5
#Some dmgs are always the same on all difficulties (like fireballs, potions)

  spawnRate: 100   #You can set the chance of mob spawning. 100 is 100%, which is default. 
#Unfortunately it can only go down from 100 to 0, so if you want more of certain mob, you can try to decrease the spawn rate of all the other mobs in the area, so that this one will have more 'room' so occupy.
#For gameplay reasons, it will only work on mobs spawned naturally, so commands, spawn eggs, spawners aren't affected. It won't also work on mobs spawned inside structures eg. Elder Guardians, Underwater Ruins Drowneds, Mansion Evokers ect...
#======== If you want a mob entirely out of existance (it will always disappear no matter what spawn method is used, this also works on the 'structure mobs'), set it to '-1' =========
