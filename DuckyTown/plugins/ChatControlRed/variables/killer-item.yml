# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ChatControl supports dynamic, high performance variables you create! They can be used across
# the plugin, for example in formatting your chat or death messages. Currently, the folder
# variables/ stores all custom variables in each separate yml file.
#
# Variables can not only be used to display information, but because you can write your own full
# code in JavaScript to display them, they can also do whatever you would wish for your
# players/server, such as sneaking in code to send sounds or spawn monsters.
#
# Coding this variable requires a little bit of JavaScript knowledge, see the link below.
#
# For documentation and help, please see this link:
# https://github.com/kangarko/ChatControl-Red/wiki/JavaScript-Variables
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Where should this variable be used?
#
# FORMAT = used in your formats with {syntax}, players cannot use it
# MESSAGE = players can use it with [syntax] in their chat messages
Type: MESSAGE

# The key is the word we look for surrounded by brackets [] OR {}, example:
# Chat message: "Hello everyone, I have an [item] in my hand"
Key: "killer_item"

# The value the key will be replaced to.
# This uses JavaScript and must return a boolean value.
Value: |-

    // A valid JavaScript code follows below. You can use the "player" variable to get
    // Bukkit's player instance.

        // shall we use if killer had no item
        var textColor = '&a';
